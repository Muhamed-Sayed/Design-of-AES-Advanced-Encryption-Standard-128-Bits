# Design-of-AES-Advanced-Encryption-Standard-128-Bits
Based on (RIJNDAEL) Encryption Algorithm 10 rounds using Verilog (simulated and synthesized using Quartus,Vivado and ISE Design Suite) implemented on DE0-CV FPGA.

# Abstract
In this document we will provide a detailed and easy to understand explanation of the implementation of the AES (RIJNDAEL) encryption algorithm and then we will show and discuss the results of our design. In order to fulfill the requirements of executing precise calculations and less power & area consumption, we performed many optimizations.

# Tools used
## For Virtex-7 FPGA on VC-709 Board: 
- We used ISE DESIGN SUITE14.7 and VIVADO2018.3 to make the synthesis, simulation and get all the needed results.
## For DE0-CV FPGA : 
- We used Quartus Prime21.1 to complete the FPGA flow and QuestaSim to check the functionality by making the behavioral simulation.
